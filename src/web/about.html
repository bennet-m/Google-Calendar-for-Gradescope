        <h1> About GradeSync</h1>
        <p>
            GradeSync was created by Bennet Matazzoni and Roman De Santos, two Harvey Mudd College Students who found the current assignment managment system by Gradescope annoying.
            The Gradescope website forces you to tab through each 
            page to see the assignment due dates and does not collate them into a viewer firendly calendar. <br>
            <br>
            Knowing when your homework is due should <b>not</b> be a struggle. <br>
            <br>
            So, we decided to make an app to collect your assignments from your most recent semester and place them into your Google Calendar. 
            As your Instructors add or remove assignments, your calendar will update while your Computer is on. 
            After exporting your assignments to Google Calendar, you can create ical files or a shareable link to export your assignments to any scheduling program you prefer or keep using Google Calendar. 
            If your school uses Gradescope, we hope this app can streamline your assignment workflow. <br>
            <br>
            Since this is a student-made project, we are not able to buy the expensive app developer certificates to remove system warnings for users, but our source code 
            is available on <a href="https://github.com/bennet-m/Google-Calendar-for-Gradescope.git">GitHub</a> for anyone to review. 
            If you are interested in a brief overview of how your data is used, please take a look at our <a href = "./privacy.html"> Privacy Policy</a>.
